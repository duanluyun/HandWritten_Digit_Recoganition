# HandWritten_Digit_Recoganition
An implementation of multilayer neural network using Tensorflow. 


Currently,support vector machines(SVMs) are extensively used for recognizing handwritten digits because of their high performance in pattern recognition. SVMs are binary classfiers based on the underlying structural risk minimization
principle. They procced by mapping data into a high dimensional dot product space via a kernel function.In this space an optimal hyperplane,that maximizes the margin of separation between the two classes,is calculated.
